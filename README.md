# SN_RKHS

This file contains the Matlab code for the paper "AN RKHS APPROACH FOR PIVOTAL INFERENCE IN FUNCTIONAL LINEAR REGRESSION" by Holger Dette and Jiajun Tang

This file contians:

(1) sample_code.m: A sample simulation code for computing empirical rejection probabilities. This simulation takes several hours to finish.

(2) TandV.m: a function that computes \hat{T}_n and \hat{V}_n in the paper.

(3) bike.m: code for real data example Bike-sharing.

(4) bikeshare.txt: The Bike-sharing data of Captial Bike Sharing (CBS), obtained from R package ISLR2.
